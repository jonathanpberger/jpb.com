# Sustainable Pace, Agile, and The Big Design Refactor
Lean UX NYC, 2013

Jonathan Berger, Pivotal Labs

# 1. Sustainable Pace

---

# Call to arms

---

I see many
## unhappy designers

---

designers feel
## overwhelmed

---

wasn't agile supposed to be a
## solution?

---

instead, designers feel
## rushed

---

designers feel
## disempowered

---

designers
## billing model

---
<!-- ## promises are made

--- -->

options?
## work harder

---

work
## longer

---

asked to work at someone else's
## tempo

---

this is an
## unwinnable race

---

---

## design culture

---

## rock star

---

## all nighters

---

## design-school crit

---

## expected to be right

---

## expected to be perfect

---

---

## sustainable pace

---

## constant speed

---

## empathy

---


---


## call to arms

---

# designers should adopt sustainable pace as a value

---

---

# 2. Agile

---

## solution

---

## problem

---

## Why?

---

## similar problems

---

- Sclerosis around processes and tools,
- Compulsive (CYA) documentation,
- Endless negotiation about targets and deliverables,
- A fixation on following old plans in a new situations.

---

- *Individuals & interactions* over processes & tools
- *Working software* over comprehensive documentation
- *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
- *Responding to change* over following a plan

---

instead of
## designers coping with Agile

---

why aren't we asking
# "How can Agile serve designers?"

---

---

# 3. Big Design Refactor

---

## In the beginning...

---

There's a
## visual design system

---

Then
## the project goes Agile

---

Development solutions
## I.N.V.E.S.T., small pieces
<br />
Design solutions
## Malleable, never done, holistic

---

## product iterates

---

## degrades under the weight of a thousand tiny changes

---

## designers have to play catch-up in a race they can't win

---

---

## Understand and accept

---

## this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles

---
= id=prayer

## Agile Designers Prayer

> Grant me the serenity

> To accept the things I cannot change

> The courage to change the things I can

> And the wisdom to know the difference

---

## Designers need not work at developers tempo

---

## stay *in-rhythm* with development,<br /> not *on-pace*

---

---

## Communicate

---

## keep an eye on the health of the graphic system

---

## manage your design debt

---

## How?
- Mention that the system is breaking down
- Keep solving the tactical problems
- keep delivering value

---

## the balance shifts

---

## raise the alarm

---

## Design retro

---

## Do systematic visual Design

---

## What DOES THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR look like?
- mostly at whiteboards or Adobe Creative Suite
- include product ~4-7x / week
- ping development ~1-2x / week to consult on technical implications

---

## Near the end of Big design refactor
- deliver a set of user stories accompanied by mockups
- It’ll often take an IPM or two to get through all of them
- it’s important that they get implemented soon

---

## Costs of delay
- Nothing feels more like waste than a heavy investment in design
- followed by unacted-upon stories that go stale
- This will kill trust between design product (in both directions)

---

## After the Big Design refactor
- new design is being built
- designers occasionally hop back into Adobe for assets or newly-discovered UX tweaks
- most design time is spent pairing with developers

---

## until the next refactor

- designers pair on stories, work on design problems revealed by user testing
- ~66% development and 33% Adobe apps
- The debt clock is starting to tick again, and once the pain is noticeable, start making noises

---

## “we’re ok for right now, but we’ll need a design refactor in the next 3-5 weeks”

---

##...and the cycle repeats

---
# work with the Big Design Refactor, not against it.

---

---

# Call to Action

---

# Call to Arms

---

# Designers should recognize the rhythms and tempos of design and development.

---

# Designers should look to agile as a solution, not a problem.

---

# Designers should adopt sustainable pace as a value.

---
