“Cooperation panel”
COOPERATION
Cooperation between programmers and designers

Designers and programmers may inhabit the same work space but more often than not they inhabit different worlds. This is not an optimal situation and, like all sub-optimal situations, needs to be addressed and improved to the benefit of all concerned, not least our clients and users. This session will be a no-holds-barred discussion about the roadblocks, dead-ends and pitfalls but also the great opportunities for closer collaboration and success stories of cooperation gone right.

As ever, the devils (and angels) are in the details so we will delve right into methods of work, examples of what has gone right (and not quite so right) on projects, and lessons learned. As technology becomes commoditised and skills are forever sharpened, success will come from placing increasing value on successful communication within teams, to help everyone reach their potential, and polish delivery of products as beautiful to use as they are robust and reliable.

This session is moderated by Ralph Talmont, a “communications guy” who has made the jump over the digital divide from publishing and publication design to building and advising technology companies.
