# Towards a Theory and Methodology of Testâ€‘Driven Design

# Goals
- designers should have the benefits of TDD
- figure out how to bride the gap bw engineering and design for TDD
- gave an objective "design is healthy" red/green

Automated design testing can address a number of design pains, e.g.:


- Enforce code conventions using linting tools: [idiomatic.js][], [idiomatic-css][]
- documenting the design of an app at a state in time
- help make cucumber / feature tests more focused, help devs write them more like a real person and go through the actual workflows. "Cuke it like a human (GH)"
- safely refactoring horrible CSS: [css-ratiocinator][]
- help enforce the (live) style guide
- keep the DOM clean and semantic
- enforce good stylesheet structure / best practices
- ensure modules are implemented w/ proper DOM
- explicitly assert design decisions

# Risks

- testing is more trouble than its worth
- ppl won't understand because I'm too technical
- ppl get bored
- adding overhead to team flow


# Users

- Designers who would benefit from DoD but don't know about it
- Designers who are aware of TDD
- Ppl building this testing tech who're stuck in the cargo rut
