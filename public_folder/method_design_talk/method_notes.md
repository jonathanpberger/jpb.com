# Designing Agile Design
Lean/Agile processes as a designer working in a mostly developer environment

# Lindsay

I looked through your talk at Agile UX and I think that most of this will be great for the brown bag.

Lean/Agile processes as a designer working in a mostly developer environment
would be the most useful to our team as we are the inverse of that.

That being said, identifying specific tools is great

I would focus less on tools

and more on ways of working.

For instance, why are In-Browser mock-ups a useful tool?

When/at what stage do you use them and to what fidelity do you take them?

Hope that helps. I'm looking forward to it!

## Tip 9:
# Per Project Fluid Apps
- Working on multiple projects at once?
- Fluid apps help you control your context and focus

## Interlude
# Different rhythms
- Design and development have a different pace
- up-front design should be rough
- plan for a ~quarterly Graphic System refactor
- don't be afraid to let the design degrade for the sake of rapid iteration
