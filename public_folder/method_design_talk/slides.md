# Hello

### 7 Tips for

# Practicing UX Design

### that I learned 

# from Agile Development

> Jonathan Berger, Pivotal Labs

> for Method Design, September 2012

---
The plan:
# ~45 minutes
(20 minute talk 
+ time for discussion)

---

# What I'll try to do:
> lead a discussion about Lean/Agile processes as a designer working in a mostly developer environment


---
Origin Story
# Why am I here?
> Why have I spent the last few years doing Pivotal-Tracker-oriented Test-Driven Development at Pivotal Labs?

---
It started with 
# Spot.us

---
I saw what the 
# Agile process did for Devs 
and I thought

---
# Designers can haz?!

---
> I believe that design tasks have similar problems to those which that led to Agile development, and can benefit from similar techniques.

# What is 'Agile'?

---
## Agile Manifesto

- *Individuals & interactions* over *processes & tools*

- *Working software* over *comprehensive doc'n*

- *Customer collaboration* over *contract negotiation*

- *Responding to change* over *following a plan*

---
## Agile on one foot:
# Optimize for a low cost of change.

---
## How do we Optimize for a low cost of change
# for Design?

---
# 7 Tips & Techniques & Tactics

---
## Tip 1: Label mock-ups and assets
# Use Ubiquitous language
- Use the same terms for the same things in Design, Development, and the Domain

---
## Tip 2: Humans are narrative creatures
# Design for Narrative
- Consistent test stories lead to better products.
- Bring your Personae and User Flows into tests.
- Make it easy for devs to use that research (externalize).

---
## Tip 3: Pick a story
# and Stick with it 
> It's really effective to develop a default sample story and use it to mock or test or teach.

Given Harry is on the Store page

When he clicks on "Tactical Bacon"

Then "Tactical Bacon" should be added to his cart

## Post basic Userflow scripts 
## as test data

---
## Personas are more memorable
# with alliterative names
- Frank the Farmer
- Harry the Ham Lover
- Cathy the Customer Service Rep

---
## Stick to your story

# Tip 4: Optimize Physical Spaces for Conversation
> Foamcore is awesome. Create spaces to create conversation. Externalize.

---
## Mocks on Foamcore

## Foamcore == walls-without-rooms!!

---
## Tip 5: At first
# Design in Adobe Creative Suite
- Before working software is built,
- For most IA and User Flows,
- For novel interactions.

---
## Tip 6: Better yet,
# Design on a Whiteboard
- Because that's usually faster,
- And faster's often better,
- And shared surfaces (whiteboards, Post-Its, index cards) foster collaboration.

---
## Tip 7: Then,
# Design in the Browser
> When working software exists
> and your mocks start falling out of sync

---
## Use Firebug
# to manipulate the DOM
> and then take screenshots

---
## which can be hacked up
> in your favorite raster editor

---
## LIVE DEMO (time permitting)
Who's wants to deface something?

---
## this technique lets you 
# move **FAST**

---
## for bonus points
# Save the HTML
> and check it into version control
> to work on longer mocks and be able to save them

---

> Interlude: Different rhythms

- • Design and development have a different pace.
- • Up-front design should be rough.
- • Don't be afraid to let the design degrade for the sake of rapid iteration.
- • Plan for a ~quarterly Graphic System refactor.

---
## Tip 7: I can't count
# That '7 Tips' thing?
## Total lie!

---
## Tip 8: Maintain
# A sustainable pace.

## Tip 10:
# Per Project Fluid Apps
- Working on multiple projects at once?
- Fluid apps help you control your context and focus

---

## 1 Browser per project

---
## Tip 11:
# Style-Guide Driven Development

- • Started to eliminate duplication,
- • Allowed PMs to design features on the whiteboard,
- • Became a way for *developers* to reject stories.

---
## Tip 12:
# Spike-Driven Development

- • Design interactions in rails with throw-away code,
- • Screenshoot working software for mocks,
- • Cherry-pick small changes and contribute them back,
- • Devs can harvest code when they go through and TDD the stories.

---
# My Open Questions:
- • Does any of this map to the design you do?
- • What are your tips?
