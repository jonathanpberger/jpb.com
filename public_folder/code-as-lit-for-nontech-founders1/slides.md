## What do I do?

- • I'm an entrepreneur with a fashion startup called <https://marketpublique.com>
- • I'm a designer and developer who builds products every day at <https://pivotallabs.com>
- • I occasionally speak and blog and post all that at <https://jonathanpberger.com>

## Who are you?
(Show of hands)

---
Whose primary role is as a
# Doer?
Bizdev, Marketing, Analysis

---
Whose primary role is as a
# Maker?
Design, Development

---
Who's currently
# working on their own company?

---
Who's planning on
# launching this year?

---
Who's on a team
# without a technical cofounder?

---
## The Plan
- 1: Why "Literacy" is a useful way to discuss becoming technical
- 2: Why Coding literacy helps Non-Technical Founders
- 3: How to become literate

---
Part 1:
# Why "Literacy"?

---
## Why "Coding as Literacy"?
It's a good way to talk about coding, which is often treated as a binary.

---

If you work in a technical medium,
# TECHNOLOGY IS POWERFUL

---
# BUT

---
Learning hard technical skills is
# SCARY

---
Remember
# Literacy != Fluency

---
Getting technical doesn't have to be a
# full-time commitment

---
You just need enough to
# read the writing on the wall

---
Part 2:
# How does Code Literacy Help Founders?

---
## The Anna Karenina Principle

> Happy families are all alike;

> every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

---
## The Reverse Anna Karenina Law of Startups

> Failed startups are all alike;

> every successful startup is successful in its own way.

---

## Common Causes Startup Failure:
(failing to nail these questions)

- • Who has a problem? (Customers)
- • What's the solution? (Product)
- • How do I build it? (Team)
- • Why will they pay me? (Business Model)
- • Where can I find runway? (Funding)

---

## Common Causes of Startup Death

- • Who has a problem? (Customers)
- • What's the solution? (Product)
- • **How do I build it? (Team)**
- • Why will they pay me? (Business Model)
- • Where can I find runway? (Funding)

---
## The Iron Triangle
- • Scope
- • Schedule
- • Cost

(Pick two.)

---

## Agile methodologies were
# built to address Iron Triangle risk.

---

## My Thesis:
> Code Literacy helps Non-Technical Founders mitigate Scope risk.

---
## Areas of risk for
# Non-Technical Founders

---
## Risk from Honest Mistakes
- • Engineers <3 over-engineering,
- • Paying others for what founders could do themselves,
- • Misunderstanding technical cost (trying to do too much),
- • Misunderstanding technical complexity (trying something that's too hard),
- • Misunderstanding what's interesting (me-too ism).

---

## Almost all this risk can be mitigated by
# (technical) context

(more on that in a minute)

---
## Risk from Dishonest Mistakes
- • Founders left without access to their code.
- • Getting the run-around from devs.

---
## Risk from Dishonest Mistakes
- • <s>Founders left without access to their code.</s> Understand version control.
- • <s>Getting the run-around from devs.</s> Understand basic principles.

---
Part 3:
# Becoming literate

---
I started as
# a self-taught designer

---
I worked on [Spot.Us](https://spot.us) and
# found Agile and fell in love.

---

## I started
# Picking up on what I heard around me

---
## For me, this looked like

> CSS, HTML, Erb => TDD, Cucumber => Bash, Bundler, Rake => Git => Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine => Javascript, JQuery, the DOM => more Ruby, ORMs, REST, HTTP.



---

> Basic Techniques

In order of

`value / cost`


---
## Understand
# Github
(Git is another story altogether.)

---
## Learn to Build Static Sites
- • Learn basic HTML,
- • Learn basic CSS.

<!-- ---

## HTML looks like this

`<a class="on-sale" href="https://hamazon.com">Shop at Hamazon!</a>`

---

## CSS looks like this

  		a.on-sale {
	  		font-size: 100%;
		  	font-weight: bold;
	  	}

-->

---
> Intermediate Techniques

---
## Learn
# [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

And use it for **everything.**


---
## TDD and Story Writing
using Cucumber. Write stories at the right size.

(See my post [Writing Well-Formed Stories](https://pivotallabs.com/users/jonathanpberger/blog/articles/2333-how-to-write-well-formed-stories) for more.)

---

## TDD and Story Writing using
## Cucumber / Gherkin

**Given** I am a logged in user

**When** I click "add to cart"

**Then** the item should added to in my cart

**And** my Total Price should go up

---
## Build
# Dynamic sites
- • jQuery
- • Sinatra

<!-- ---
Intermediate Techniques:
## jQuery looks like this

		$('.on-sale').fadeOut()

---
Intermediate Techniques:
## Sinatra looks like this

		require 'sinatra'

 -->

---
## Learn
# Git
(Version control). Control your code. Even better, contribute small fixes (mostly copy and CSS).


---
> Advanced Techniques

---
# In-browser Mockups
be more precise in asking for what you want using basic CSS, HTML, and a templating framework (e.g., Erb or Haml)

---
# JQuery and the DOM
contribute interactions. Simple stuff is really pretty easy.

Rules I Learned
## About Learning Technical Things
- • Learn what the web is built of (internet architecture),
- • Immersion/osmosis is a powerful teaching tool,
- • To learn, it's critically important to **do** things and get feedback, not just read about them.

---
Tastes I cultivated
## About Learning Technical Things
- • Tools are important (but don't obsess over them),
- • Develop the sense of when to ask for help and when to tough it out,
- • Develop the sense of smell of knowing when you should go along with Magic, and when you have to learn how it works under the hood.

# What Next?
Learn Something! Learn a little HTML! And CSS! Get your hands dirty!

# Bonus Level!
Wherein I try to show examples if there's time.

---

## Popular Web Languages

- PHP (wordpress, drupal)
- .net
- Ruby (Rails, Sinatra)
- Python (Django)
- Javascript (Node)

---
## Test Driven Development
- Red
- Green
- Refactor

---
## Pair Programming + The Pivotal Way
<https://bit.ly/conceptsofpivotaltracker>

---
## Making is good for projects
- • Small details are important, especially to the user. They fall by the wayside.
- • There's a whole class of things for which it takes more time to explain it than to do.
- • This is tech literacy's sweet spot for designers and PO's and leads to a *dramatic* increase in think-make-check speed.

---
## Making is good for teams
- • Lend a helping hand to development work at the edges,
- • Avoid resource bottlenecks,
- • Build respect and camraderie, reduce "us-vs.-them"

---
## Making is good for individuals
- • Building things feels **awesome**
- • "Instead of telling someone else how to paint, you get to hold the brush."

---

## Where can literacy help?
- • Designer, PO: Better tactical design choices and execution, more team bandwidth,
- • Principal: better strategic design choices, more realistic estimates, better analytical tools.
- • Developer: uhhh...

---

## Where can literacy hurt?
- • Design, PM, Principal: time / opportunity cost, overstepping bounds, loss of innocence
- • Developer: tunnel vision can skew priorities

---
## In general, more literacy is better
(no matter what the role)

---
# but...

---
never forget
## Sometimes design is an **ineffable value-add** and code needs to take the backseat.
Preserve the ability / reserve the right to stay innocent and come up with crazy ideas that the Technically Literate deem impossible.
